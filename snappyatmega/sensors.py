""" ATMega128RFA1 Temperature and Power Supply Sensors

   Notes:
    1. Each ATMega sensor varies by several degrees so it needs to be calibrated once for offset against
       the actual temperature and the offset stored in non-volatile memory. I recommend the Yocto sensor
       to calibrate against: http://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/products/usb-environmental-sensors/yocto-temperature
    2. Does not read and subtract voltage offset error of differential signal processor as suggested by datasheet
       because datasheet says it only makes 1 count difference, and above offset calculation will
       probably account for it.
    3. It also warms up several degrees if the SNAP is awake most of the time, so ambient measurements can
       only be made after a long sleep or low-duty-cycle wake time
